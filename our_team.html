					<h2>HANNAH</h2>
					<p>Hannah is a sophomore at NYU majoring in Social Studies Education with a minor in Global and Urban Education and hopes to one day teach high school US History. Hannah is currently working on the curriculum board for TTD, is a member of NYU Alternative Breaks, and serving as Corresponding Secretary on the Chapter Council of her sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma. Growing up Hannah studied ballet at Boston Ballet, and performed in their production of the Nutcracker as both an angel and a soldier. While it's been some time since she's been on the dance floor, she is eager to see students learn and grow through dance as she did through TTD's programming.</p>

					<h2>LINDA WANG</h2>
					<p>Linda is the marketing director of TTD. I am always in search of new experiences, and I accept challenges as problems that can be solved once given enough thinking. I aspire to inspire, help and mentor those around me. I am also interested in the intersection between art, media and communications. I have worked as a PR intern at MSLGroup, an affiliated PR agency of Publicis Groupe, where I had a chance to use strategic communication skills to increase vitality for different brands, including Electrolux, Abbott and Allergan etc. I also interned at the marketing department of Glow Recipe, a Korean beauty company, where I gained video editing and copy writing skills. On the other hand, I am a professional pianist with more than 15 years of piano playing experience. I believe music and art can help young teenagers to improve critical thinking skills.</p>

					<h2>ALLIE</h2>
					<p>Allie is a Manhattan-based filmmaker who grew up with a camcorder in one hand and ballet slippers in the other. She was heavily influenced by her exposure to the arts at a very young age -- from modern dance, tap, and ballet, to theater and even live television. For Allie, art is more than just an extra-curricuar -- it is a way to learn about yourself and the world, and express complicated emotions and ideas. Through her work with TTD, Allie is combining her love of filmmaking with her desire to share the arts with others.</p>
