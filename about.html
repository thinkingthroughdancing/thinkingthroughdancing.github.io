			<h2>Our Story Behind Thinking Through Dancing</h2>
			<p>Thinking Through Dancing (TTD) is an organization that provides an interdisciplinary learning opportunity for motivated local students and International students in the State of Maine. Led by a full team of talented NYU undergraduates, TTD students develop creative and critical thinking skills through dance, choreography, history, reading, and writing. We believe that every child in the world has their own unique talents and potentials, and TTD strives to create an environment for those who are willing to challenge themselves, to explore their own passion and interests, and to develop their own personalities and characteristics by adapting to new experiences. 
			<br /><br />
			There is no better place to implement such a dynamic program than in Blue Hill, Maine one of the few remaining traditional New England towns in the state. Its peaceful and placid environment allows students to learn to be calm and to concentrate on self developments. Nature has a unique quality to bond people together and create a community, therefore people in Maine cherish it dearly. TTD integrates Maine-specific activities into the program, such as lobstering, hiking, camping, kayaking, biking, etc. to allow students to fully immerse themselves into the environment. TTD believes that the pristine atmosphere in Blue Hill will keep students from distraction and to be fully absorb themselves into a humanistic environment and in dance. 
			<br /><br />
			During the three week spectrum of the camp, both TTD staff and students will follow to a well-designed curriculum which aligns with a combination of college seminars and an NYU choreography class, taught by Aly Rose, the choreographer for 2008 Beijing Olympic Ceremony. TTD curriculum is designed with a holistic pedagogy that is balanced in reading, writing, dancing, and choreographing. Every year, TTD will create a theme and TTD staff will conduct research and plan the coursework based on the theme to ensure the quality of the learning experience. Curriculum subjects includes, but not limited to history, literature, movie, music, dance, art. Choreography is an important element in TTD curriculum. Because it requires so much analytical and creative thinking skills in dance and other academic subjects, TTD centers  its curriculum around a choreographic approach. With no previous dance experience required, students will learn to make their own dance, to improvise with emotions and messages, and to collaborate with peers to reflect back to the knowledge they gained from their seminar classes, and most importantly become creators. Dance is a vehicle that allows students to explore different paths possibilities in life permeate in their lives.
			<br /><br />
			In the guidance of Aly, TTD Cofounders Charcy Ye and Michael Kim learned tremendously about the art of dance and choreography, but more significant, they learned that success comes from an intensive amount of work and hope. Since the program includes college material and requires an intensive amount of work, it is highly recommended for motivated and concentrated students, who are willing to challenge themselves. The dynamic between a peaceful environment and an intensive curriculum provide a balance and inspirational combo for success for TTD students.</p>
